This is <b>Compression</b>, an expert modpack for 1.19.2.  
You play as the God of Entropy who has been trapped by the God of Space and the God of Time in a Dimensional Prison where they thought you would spend the rest of eternity, cursed to be unable to truly die and decay. Ironic.  
However, if you're clever and automate processes, research advanced technology and harvest all the resources you can find you might get lucky and escape.  
Can you overcome the odds stacked against you? Or will you give up and remain trapped forever?  

### About Compression
The goal of this pack is to provide an unique modded Minecraft experience, focusing on interesting automation challenges while minimizing unnecessary grind.  
Each mod is carefully integrated into the modpack, with most of them having their progression fully altered.  
Automation is key, with a design inspired by games like Factorio and many new mechanics that make no part feel neglected.

### Stuck in a dimensional prison
The world you'll be playing in is not a normal world. This world is fragmented in hexagonal pieces, each one coming from a different land, even ones you normally wouldn't find in the Overworld. These fragments, also known as [Hexlands](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hexlands-ii), are contained by an incredibly strong material that cannot be destroyed in any way...unless?  

### Progression
The gameplay loop of Compression centers around science. You make it, you test it, you analyze it. Knowledge from experiments feeding into schematic and constructs leading you along unlocking the nature of reality and bending it to your will.  
Within the quest book you will find 16 distinct tiers of progression leading you to the End. Each tier you will face increasingly difficult to construct and test sciences, each tick up the progression ladder further testing your will to continue.

### Quest Book
The quest book is divided into three main sections.
- Path to Null: The main quest line, leading you through the tiers. Start simple, end with █████████.
- Recipe Scaling: Production path improvements, to ensure you can meet the demands of the newer technologies.
- Automation and you!: Tutorial quests for the more complex automations. Includes a Proficiency tab, acting as a trophy tab and a proof of automation check.

### Quest Rewards
Each tier's quests offer special berries as a reward. Collecting all the berries for a tier, will reward you with a Golden Berry that can be displayed as a trophy.  
<sub><sub>Warning: These berries are not for human (or god) consumption. Consuming one can lead to severe side effects, such as internal organ compression or [REDACTED].</sub></sub>

### Custom Ponders
Many existing and new mechanics come with in-game tutorials through custom Create ponders, made by JJFireblast101.


### Recipe Scaling
In Compression, processing lines can be upgraded as you progress. No need to tear down your hard work because a better solution is available or scale up a lower tier process to ludicrous degrees.  
The ore line is also subjected to an extreme degree of recipe scaling. Each tier you move up in progression the total drops per ore will roughly quadruple baring few exceptions. Each tier up boosts previous tiers and introduces a new byproduct.


## Currently: Tier 0 is available to play. Tier 1 is actively being worked on.
